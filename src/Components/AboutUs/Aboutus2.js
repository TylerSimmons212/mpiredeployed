                <h1>We are The Brothers</h1>
                <p>We are Brand Builders and entrepreneurs. We love challenging projects. We are convinced that any brand can win on any budget with the right strategy. We have a history of building profitable companies by leveraging the power of the digital media world. We've founded, built, and sold online businesses that generated over $1 million within 12 months of creation with less than $10,000.<br/><br/>
                Our life-changing moment was when we took it upon ourselves to start our digital marketing efforts through affiliate programs. We quickly discovered the money in marketing. We knew then that this is what we wanted to do for the rest of our lives. Our start in affiliate marketing made us who we are today as all our efforts were commission-based and self-funded. Our campaigns had to show profitability, or it was game over. Since then, We've had years of experience in agency, affiliate, eCom, and start-ups.<br/><br/>
                Now, you can find us building some of the most memorable and strongest brands on the rise today. We've been a leading role behind over $300,000,000 in trackable sales, 400 million video ad views, 5 million social shares, and 15k press features. Brands Weâ€™ve been working on have been featured in AdWeek, Forbes, Time, etc...</p>

                                We've been doing this for over 20 years combined. We started with running ads for affiliate offers and generated well over 6 figures per month.
